The topic for this weekâ€™s homework is the perceptron algorithm for sentiment classification of tweets. You will get a data set of tweets and some starter code. We ask you to implement the inference and estimation algorithms for basic perceptron, averaged perceptron and the margin-infused relaxed algorithm (MIRA), which is a variant of the standard perceptron al- gorithm.
